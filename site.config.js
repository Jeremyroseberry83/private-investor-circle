/**
 * Central config for PrivateInvestorCircle.com.
 *
 * The palette follows the live site, not the Private Gathering Overview PDF —
 * the two are different systems and the live one is what prospects meet, and
 * what the circle logo was drawn for:
 *   Near-black #161311 · Champagne #D8C3A5 · Warm ivory #FAF7F2
 *
 * Champagne carries the accent weight on dark grounds (11:1 on INK) and deep
 * taupe carries it on light (5.1:1 on BG) — champagne itself is far too pale
 * for text on ivory. GOLD #D8B46C is sampled from the PDF and is deliberately
 * restricted to hairlines and the mark: when it was doing every job at once it
 * read as mustard.
